## Introduction

The provided CSV file contains sales data, but it is known to have numerous errors and inconsistencies. This project aims to clean the data thoroughly using a predefined template, add additional functions if required, and perform data analysis to gain insights into the sales trends, patterns, and statistics. 

## Data

The dataset for this project is provided in a CSV file named " supermarket_sales_dirty.csv". It includes various columns such as date, product, quantity, price, customer information, and sales information. However, the data is known to contain errors, missing values, and inconsistencies.

## Data Cleaning Strategy

The data cleaning process will involve several steps to address the errors, inconsistencies, and missing values within the dataset. The strategy includes:

1. Loading the CSV file and examining the structure and format of the data.
2. Identifying and handling missing values by imputation or removal, depending on the context and impact on the analysis.
3. Correcting data errors, such as typos, incorrect formatting, and outliers, using appropriate data cleaning techniques.
4. Handling data inconsistencies, such as inconsistent date formats, inconsistent encoding, and inconsistent product names.
5. Verifying data integrity and ensuring consistency across related columns.
6. Documenting the cleaning steps taken and providing explanations for any transformations or adjustments made to the data.

## Data Analysis

After cleaning the dataset, we will perform descriptive and inferential analysis to gain insights into the sales data. The analysis may include:

1. Descriptive statistics: Calculating measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range for relevant columns to understand the central tendency, dispersion, and distribution of the data.
2. Time-series analysis: Analyzing sales trends over time and identifying seasonal patterns or trends.
3. Correlation analysis: Investigating the relationships between different variables, such as quantity sold, price, and customer demographics.
4. Sales performance analysis: Examining top-selling products, identifying high-value customers, and evaluating sales performance based on various criteria.
5. Visualizations: Creating charts, graphs, and plots to visualize the data and highlight key insights and trends.

## Execution and Submission

To execute this project, follow these steps:

1. Download the " supermarket_sales_dirty.csv" file.
2. Open the provided notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment or any other compatible IDE.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially, ensuring that the outputs are visible.
4. Execute the data cleaning, analysis, and data warehousing sections, documenting the steps taken and adding analysis explanations as required.
5. Save the notebook with the executed outputs visible
